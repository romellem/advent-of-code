## --- Day 24: Lobby Layout ---

Your raft makes it to the tropical island; it turns out that the small crab was an excellent navigator. You make your way to the resort.

As you enter the lobby, you discover a small problem: the floor is being renovated. You can't even reach the check-in desk until they've finished installing the _new tile floor_.

The tiles are all _hexagonal_; they need to be arranged in a [hex grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_tiling) with a very specific color pattern. Not in the mood to wait, you offer to help figure out the pattern.

The tiles are all _white_ on one side and _black_ on the other. They start with the white side facing up. The lobby is large enough to fit whatever pattern might need to appear there.

A member of the renovation crew gives you a _list of the tiles that need to be flipped over_ (your puzzle input). Each line in the list identifies a single tile that needs to be flipped by giving a series of steps starting from a _reference tile_ in the very center of the room. (Every line starts from the same reference tile.)

Because the tiles are hexagonal, every tile has _six neighbors_: east, southeast, southwest, west, northwest, and northeast. These directions are given in your list, respectively, as `e`, `se`, `sw`, `w`, `nw`, and `ne`. A tile is identified by a series of these directions with _no delimiters_; for example, `esenee` identifies the tile you land on if you start at the reference tile and then move one tile east, one tile southeast, one tile northeast, and one tile east.

Each time a tile is identified, it flips from white to black or from black to white. Tiles might be flipped more than once. For example, a line like `esew` flips a tile immediately adjacent to the reference tile, and a line like `nwwswee` flips the reference tile itself.

Here is a larger example:

    sesenwnenenewseeswwswswwnenewsewsw
    neeenesenwnwwswnenewnwwsewnenwseswesw
    seswneswswsenwwnwse
    nwnwneseeswswnenewneswwnewseswneseene
    swweswneswnenwsewnwneneseenw
    eesenwseswswnenwswnwnwsewwnwsene
    sewnenenenesenwsewnenwwwse
    wenwwweseeeweswwwnwwe
    wsweesenenewnwwnwsenewsenwwsesesenwne
    neeswseenwwswnwswswnw
    nenwswwsewswnenenewsenwsenwnesesenew
    enewnwewneswsewnwswenweswnenwsenwsw
    sweneswneswneneenwnewenewwneswswnese
    swwesenesewenwneswnwwneseswwne
    enesenwswwswneneswsenwnewswseenwsese
    wnwnesenesenenwwnenwsewesewsesesew
    nenewswnwewswnenesenwnesewesw
    eneswnwswnwsenenwnwnwwseeswneewsenese
    neswnwewnwnwseenwseesewsenwsweewe
    wseweeenwnesenwwwswnew
    

In the above example, 10 tiles are flipped once (to black), and 5 more are flipped twice (to black, then back to white). After all of these instructions have been followed, a total of _`10`_ tiles are _black_.

Go through the renovation crew's list and determine which tiles they need to flip. After all of the instructions have been followed, _how many tiles are left with the black side up?_

## --- Part Two ---

The tile floor in the lobby is meant to be a living art exhibit. Every day, the tiles are all flipped according to the following rules:

*   Any _black_ tile with _zero_ or _more than 2_ black tiles immediately adjacent to it is flipped to _white_.
*   Any _white_ tile with _exactly 2_ black tiles immediately adjacent to it is flipped to _black_.

Here, _tiles immediately adjacent_ means the six tiles directly touching the tile in question.

The rules are applied _simultaneously_ to every tile; put another way, it is first determined which tiles need to be flipped, then they are all flipped at the same time.

In the above example, the number of black tiles that are facing up after the given number of days has passed is as follows:

    Day 1: 15
    Day 2: 12
    Day 3: 25
    Day 4: 14
    Day 5: 23
    Day 6: 28
    Day 7: 41
    Day 8: 37
    Day 9: 49
    Day 10: 37
    
    Day 20: 132
    Day 30: 259
    Day 40: 406
    Day 50: 566
    Day 60: 788
    Day 70: 1106
    Day 80: 1373
    Day 90: 1844
    Day 100: 2208
    

After executing this process a total of 100 times, there would be _`2208`_ black tiles facing up.

_How many tiles will be black after 100 days?_
